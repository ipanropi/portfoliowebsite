                    Hello! I'm Muhammad Irfan Bin Mohd Ropi

                    Welcome to my page! I'm a second-year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying Computer Science and Data Science. I'm here on a scholarship from Malaysia, which I got because of my good grades (I've got a CGPA of 3.8!).

                    At university, I'm part of the Malaysian Student Organization. It's a great group where we Malaysian students get together, share experiences, and have fun. It's like a little piece of home for me here in Madison.

                    When I'm not busy with my studies, I have a bunch of hobbies. I like to stay fit, so I work out regularly. I'm also a big fan of video games â€“ they're my go-to way to relax. Reading books and fishing are my other hobbies. I love the peace and quiet of fishing, and reading always keeps my mind sharp.

                    My big goal after university is to become a software engineer. I want to be part of a team that creates apps that really help people in their everyday lives. I'm all about working hard, learning as much as I can, and being a good team player.

                    This website is my space to share my university journey, what I learn, and where I'm heading in my career. Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a bit about me!
